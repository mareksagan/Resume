• Developing a Big Data processing system for DHL Express; created new features of and tuning the credit risk management financial products running on low latency Linux system; acted according to the industry regulations and business requirements / standards compliance

• Developing a centralised Drivers' Registry for the Ministry of Transport of the Czech Republic; worked mainly on the backend/web services part of the system developed in C#/ASP.NET and WCF; also worked on the stored procedures of the SQL Server instance utilised by the system

Confident I will prove valuable to your company and therefore submit my CV for your review. I would also like to request a personal meeting to discuss your upcoming goals and how I can help you achieve them.

I am looking forward to your call.
